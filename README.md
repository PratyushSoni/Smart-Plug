## Overview

The Smart Plug is a DIY project designed to provide real-time monitoring and control of electrical appliances. With this plug, you can measure voltage, current, power, energy consumption, and power factor of any device plugged into it. The data is then sent to a web interface for convenient visualization and analysis.

[Insert a brief description of the project, its purpose, and why it's valuable.]

## Features

- **Voltage Monitoring:** Measure the voltage supplied to the connected appliance.

- **Current Monitoring:** Accurately measure the current flowing through the plug.

- **Power Measurement:** Calculate real-time power consumption of the connected device.

- **Energy Tracking:** Keep track of energy consumption over time.

- **Power Factor Calculation:** Determine the power factor of the load.

- **Wireless Connectivity:** Utilizes the ESP8266 module for Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing remote monitoring and control.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Visualize and analyze data through a web-based dashboard.

## Materials

To build this project, you will need the following materials:

1. 5V Enclosed Power Supply.
2. ESP8266 (Wi-Fi capable) microcontroller.
3. Breadboard for prototyping.
4. Assorted wires for connections.
5. Current Transformer (CT).
6. Potential Transformer (PT) (Small PT).
7. Resistors and capacitors as required for circuitry.

[Include specific details about the components you used, such as part numbers or specifications.]

## Software

The following software tools are used for this project:

- **Arduino IDE:** To program the ESP8266 microcontroller.

- **KiCad:** For designing the circuit schematics and PCB layout.
